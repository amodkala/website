# website

source code for my personal website. like any good software engineer I've rewritten the site a dozen times using various frameworks (Hugo, Next, Hakyll, Remix, Astro, probably others I can't remember). The Platonic ideal form of my website is something like the setup at bearblog.dev, just a series of pages statically generated from markdown. My next rewrite will most likely be pure react+vite, and the following will undoubtedly be html with a custom markdown processor, so stay tuned for that.
