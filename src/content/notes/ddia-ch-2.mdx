## Relational Model vs Document Model

The relational model (most commonly SQL) organizes data into tables comprised
of rows. A common critique of this model is that mapping relational data to 
objects (as in object-oriented programming languages) requires the use of a
translation layer. Impedence mismatch is addressed by document-oriented 
databases, which allow you to store data in a common format like JSON.

Document-oriented databases make it easier to represent one-to-many 
relationships in data (e.g one LinkedIn user could have multiple job 
positions), but relational databases are better suited to handling many-to-one
or many-to-many relationships. These tend to arise when you normalize the 
database by representing frequently-duplicated information using IDs.
