## ACID

ACID is a set of safety guarantees that transactions seek to provide. It stands 
for 
- Atomicity 
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability

Atomicity (in the context of ACID) is the fault-tolerance property that for
writes grouped into one transaction, if one or more writes fail for any reason,
the entire transaction is aborted, and successful writes are rolled back.

Consistency (in ACID) is really a property of the application logic more so than
of the database -- it is the guarantee that any invariants of the data are
maintained for the duration of and following a transaction.

Isolation, better known as serializability, is the guarantee that concurrent
transactions behave as if they occurred in sequence, to ensure that operations
are applied correctly. If two transactions are applied concurrently, then one
will either see all updates made by other or none.

Durability guarantees that the data written by a succesful transaction will not
be lost unintentionally. Persisting data to disk, maintaining a write-ahead log,
and replicating data across multiple nodes are all examples of strategies that
provide durability.

## Weak Isolation Levels

Read committed is a strategy that guarantees no dirty reads and no dirty
writes. No dirty reads means that until a transaction is considered
"committed" no concurrent transactions will see the modifications made. No dirty
writes is a similar property where the result of applying concurrent
transactions should not be a combination of operations from each. One way read
committed is implemented involves concurrent locks at the object level, however
long-running transactions (like writes) may prevent other transactions from
acquiring the lock for their duration, potentially leading to cascading
slowdowns in the application. Databases may circumvent this issue by holding
both the old and new values and returning the old value to read operations for
the duration of a write operation.

Snapshot isolation is the strategy by which read ops don't block write ops, and
write ops don't block read ops. This is accomplished by maintaining multiple
versions of data at the same time, leading to the term multiple-version
concurrency control (MVCC)
