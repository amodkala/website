## Leetcode

***Wednesday, September 4, 2024***

Doing some last-minute prep for the Google OA that everyone seems to have 
received this week.

Topics
- Array techniques (sliding window, two pointer)
- String problems (palindrome, substring/subsequence, bitwise operations)
- 1-D dynamic programming
- Tree problems (distance, traversal)
- Graph problems (shortest path, number of paths)

<Link to="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/">Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters</Link>  
One-shotted this solution, basic sliding window technique with a hash table to
track the last known index of a character

<Collapsible>

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
    ref = {}
    start, end, ans = 0, 0, 0
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in ref and ref[char] >= start:
            start = ref[char] + 1
        if char not in ref or ref[char] < start:
            ans = max(ans, end - start + 1)
            end = end + 1
        ref[char] = i
    return ans
```

Took a bit longer to grok the DP method of breaking algorithms into recursive
subproblems and storing intermediate results to save on computation.

```python
def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    if len(nums) == 1:

    ref = [nums[0], max(nums[0], nums[1])]
    while i < len(nums):
        ref.append(max(nums[i] + ref[i-2], ref[i-1]))
        i = i + 1      
    return ref[len(nums)-1]

Another BFS problem, I want to be comfortable implementing graph traversal
algorithms independent of any problem-specific logic

<Collapsible>

```python
def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
    def bfs(r, c):
        moves = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]
        queue = [(r,c)]
        visited = set()
        visited.add((r,c))
        while queue:
            (r, c) = queue.pop(0)
            grid[r][c] = "0"
            for (x, y) in moves:
                valid = (r+y >= 0 and r+y < len(grid)) and (c+x >= 0 and c+x < len(grid[0]))
                if valid and grid[r+y][c+x] == "1" and (r+y,c+x) not in visited:

This is the easiest BFS problem that I'm aware exists on the Leetcode platform.
Good for practicing muscle memory

One of the classic DP problems, I ultimately needed some help with deriving the
O(n^2) solution below, though I am aware that an O(nlogn) solution exists

<Collapsible>

```python
def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    ref = [1]
    i = 1
    while i < len(nums):
        j, val = 0, 0
        while j < i:
            if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                val = max(val, ref[j])
            j = j + 1
        ref.append(1 + val)
        i = i + 1
        
    ans = 0
    for LIS in ref:
        ans = max(ans, LIS)
    return ans
```

I had to go back and review this problem because the intuition escaped me. For
posterity, ref[i-1] is the number of ways to reach step i with one step and 
likewise for ref[i-2] and two steps. Their sum is thus the number of ways to
reach step i with either one or two steps (per the problem description) and so
we simply need to calculate ref[n] (minus one to account for the step/index
mismatch)

<Collapsible>

```python
def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
    ref = [1,2]
    for i in range(2,n):
        ref.append(ref[i-1] + ref[i-2])
    return ref[n-1]
```

Climbing Stairs</Link>  
This variation on the previous problem was way more intuitive to me

```python
def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
    ans, i = 0, 2
    ref = cost[:2]
    while i < len(cost):
        ref.append(cost[i] + min(ref[i-1], ref[i-2]))
        i += 1
    return min(ref[i-1], ref[i-2])

<Link to="https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/">Merge K Sorted
Lists</Link>    
This was the first hard problem I completed, on my first attempt too! In all
fairness I was already familiar with the design of merge iterators thanks to
Alex Petrov's <Link to="https://www.databass.dev/">Database Internals</Link>,
but the requirement that I return the merged list as a linked list was a welcome
opportunity to refresh my knowledge of how to work with that data structure

<Collapsible>

```python
def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    heap = []
    head = ListNode()
    prev = head
    ref = {}
    for node in lists:
        if node is not None:
            if node.val not in ref:
                ref[node.val] = 0
            heappush(heap, (node.val, ref[node.val], node.next))
            ref[node.val] += 1
    
    while heap:
        (value, _, nextNode) = heappop(heap)
        newNode = ListNode()
        newNode.val = value
        newNode.next = None
        prev.next = newNode
        prev = prev.next
        if nextNode is not None:
            if nextNode.val not in ref:
                ref[nextNode.val] = 0
            heappush(heap, (nextNode.val, ref[nextNode.val], nextNode.next))
            ref[nextNode.val] += 1
    return head.next

<Link to="https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/">Group Anagrams</Link>  
I previously solved this problem by sorting each string, but mapping characters
to prime numbers is O(n) instead of O(nlogn)

<Collapsible>

```python
def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
    primes = [
        2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 
        43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101
    ]
    ref = {}
    for s in strs:
        val = 1
        for c in s:
            val *= primes[ord(c) - ord('a')]
        if val not in ref:
            ref[val] = []
        ref[val].append(s)
    return [words for (k, words) in ref.items()]
```

<Link to="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/">Longest
Consecutive Sequence</Link>  
I tried to be clever here and store previously computed values in a hash table,
which I discovered was necessary to avoid a TLE without modifying the algorithm,
however the space overhead is quite high (worse than ~95% of other submissions)
so I doubt it would be acceptable in an interview

<Collapsible>

```python
def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    ref = {}
    s = set(nums)
    ans = 0
    for num in s:
        length = 1
        prev = num - 1
        while prev in s:
            if prev in ref:
                length += ref[prev]
                break
            length += 1
            prev -= 1
        ref[num] = length
        ans = max(ans, length)
    return ans
```

Time to Buy and Sell Stock</Link>  
Revisited this classic since I read that Google tends to ask array/string
questions in their online assessment and I didn't want to get caught off guard.
I actually haven't done this one in forever so I got to rederive the solution

<Collapsible>

```python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    lowest, ans = prices[0], 0
    for price in prices:
        lowest = min(lowest, price)
        ans = max(ans, price - lowest)
    return ans
```

***Thursday, September 12, 2024***

Some notes on Google's snapshot coding assignment, which I wrote yesterday:
- The assignment asks candidates to solve two coding problems in 90 minutes,
  providing your own test cases to run your code against
- I'd say that the problems themselves were at the level of a Leetcode Easy (see
  "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" above), though one question explicitly asked
  for an efficient solution while the other placed more emphasis on correctness
- I managed to provide optimal solutions for both problems, tests for all the 
  edge cases I could think of, and time + space complexity analysis.

My advice for applicants writing this OA in the future is this:
- Simulate the testing environment as closely as possible during your prep. I
  think I spent more than half of the time either not writing code or making
  simple mistakes because of how nervous I was. This includes context switching
  between two problems, budgeting time, and using a timer.
- Use your own editor. Seriously. The provided editor has auto-indentation (2 
  spaces) and syntax highlighting, that's it. If you're used to writing code
  with line numbers, vim keybinds, or even dark mode you'd be shocked at how
  much of a debuff it is to go without those features.
