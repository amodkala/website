## Properties

Red-Black Trees (RB trees) are variants of binary search trees with the property
that they are balanced, meaning a maximum height of 2log(n+1) where n is the
number of nodes, and worst-case time complexity for insert, delete, and search
operations of O(log(n))

Each node in an RB tree has the following example attributes
```go
type RBTreeNode struct {
    colour Colour
    key int
    left *RBTreeNode
    right *RBTreeNode
    parent *RBTreeNode
}
```

Balance is achieved using the `colour` attribute in combination with the
following Red-Black properties:
- Every node's `colour` is either `red` or `black`
- The tree's root and leaves are all `black`
- The children of a `red` node are both `black`
- Every path from a node to its descendent leaves has the same number of `black`
  nodes
