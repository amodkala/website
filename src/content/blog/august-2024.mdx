## What I read - August 2024

In the first few weeks of August 2024 I read blog posts and technical
documentation pages about the "modern data stack" and how object storage has
enabled the design of novel scalable architectures.

### Modern data stack

My feed is full of references to specific technologies like DuckDB, dbt, the
Apache event streaming family (Kafka, Spark, Flink, etc.), and more. I spent the
month reading through technical documentation and user case studies for these
projects, and I have a few ideas for how to use them for my own projects.

is a BI tool I came across which leverages Markdown-based page generation (not 
unlike my own website!) and DuckDB in the browser (via WASM). Bonus points for 
being Toronto-based.

### Object storage

Why has S3, and object storage in general, become so ubiquitous? In an effort to
answer this question for myself I read through many blog posts, and the
consensus seems to be that object storage enables architectural paradigms like
multi-tenancy and the separation of storage and compute. Ed Huang has a great

design decisions made while implementing a serverless database.

is a serverless distributed log that implements the Kafka protocol. Reading
through their blog posts (which are very well written) is what got me interested
in the BYOC model.

is an LSM-Tree which persists data to object storage, and is a good excuse for
me to revisit classics like Kleppmann's DDIA and Petrov's Database Internals.

<Link to="https://turbopuffer.com/" target="_blank">**turbopuffer**</Link> took
the "database backed by object storage" paradigm and adapted it to the vector
store use case. Their <Link to="https://turbopuffer.com/architecture"

SlateDB's.
