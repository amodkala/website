## Projects

Ongoing
- Website (<Link to="https://github.com/amodkala/website"
  target="_blank">*code*</Link>)  
I make frequent updates to my personal website, mainly <Link
to="/blog">blog</Link> posts and <Link to="/notes">notes</Link> now that I've 
settled on a stack.

July 2024
- Waitlist  
Acuity is a popular scheduling service for
appointment-based small businesses, but they lack a
native waitlist feature. I used their REST API and Webhook
integrations along with a simple serverless architecture
(API Gateway, Lambda, Twilio API) to implement a waitlist
with SMS notifications for a local business. 

Earlier
- Transformer (<Link to="https://github.com/amodkala/transformer"
  target="_blank">*code*</Link>)  
I wrote a decoder-only transformer text classifier in 
PyTorch for my ML final. Initially trained via Google
Colab, I later rewrote my train/test/eval code for 
portability to GPU-enabled VPSes and for model export to
ONNX format.

- Raft (<Link to="https://github.com/amodkala/database"
  target="_blank">*code*</Link>)  
In an effort to self-study distributed systems, I 
implemented a distributed disk-resident log (WAL) with
eventual consistency provided by a simple implementation of
the raft consensus algorithm.
