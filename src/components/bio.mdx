*I'm on the job market! If my bio (below) aligns with an open role you are hiring for, don't hesitate to reach out.*

Hi! I'm a recent graduate of the University of Waterloo, where I obtained a degree in economics. 
In addition to my economics coursework I also took several math and computer science classes, and 
completed a few software engineering internships at startups.

You can also find me on any of these social platforms:

- <A href="https://github.com/amodkala" text="GitHub" />

For the especially curious, my [writing](/writing) is a good place to start.
