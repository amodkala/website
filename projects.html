                        <p>
                        <b>Waitlist</b><br/>
                        Acuity is a popular scheduling service for
                        appointment-based small businesses, but they lack a
                        native waitlist feature. I used their REST API and Webhook
                        integrations along with a simple serverless architecture
                        (API Gateway, Lambda, Twilio API) to implement a waitlist
                        with SMS notifications for a local business. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <b>Transformer</b><br/>
                        I wrote and trained a decoder-only transformer for text
                        classification in PyTorch for my ML final.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                        <b>Raft</b><br/>
                        I implemented a distributed disk-resident log (WAL) with
                        eventual consistency provided by a simple implementation of
                        the raft consensus algorithm.
