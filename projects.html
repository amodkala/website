                        <b>Waitlist</b><br/>
                        Acuity is a popular scheduling service for
                        appointment-based small businesses, but they lack a
                        native waitlist feature. I used their REST API and Webhook
                        integrations along with a simple serverless architecture
                        (API Gateway, Lambda, Twilio API) to implement a waitlist
                        with SMS notifications for a local business.

                        I wrote a decoder-only transformer text classifier in 
                        PyTorch for my ML final. Initially trained via Google
                        Colab, I later rewrote my train/test/eval code for 
                        portability to GPU-enabled VPSes and for model export to
                        ONNX format.

                        In an effort to self-study distributed systems, I 
                        implemented a distributed disk-resident log (WAL) with
                        eventual consistency provided by a simple implementation of
                        the raft consensus algorithm.
